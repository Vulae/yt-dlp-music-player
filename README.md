# Usage

Requires [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) & [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/).

> ⚠ **Usage will probably change a lot in the near future.**

> ⚠ **This is only tested for windows, but may have a very slim chance of actually working on other platforms.**

Set config `config.json` then run `yt-dlp-music-player.exe`

(Or use CLI arguments without a config.)

Songs may take a while to start playing on first run, needing to download all songs.

Use media controls to pause, play, & change songs.

The program will be put on the tray, you may change songs or close program there.
